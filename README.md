# To create Brewfile based on currently installed things
brew bundle dump --describe
```

## Dotfiles

# With [stow](https://homebrew-file.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)

## Nvim dev
### Rust
Run `:MasonInstall rust-analyzer`
Run `:MasonInstall codelldb`

### Lua
Run `cargo install stylua`

## Extra
Nvim uses nvchad and my config is in /lua/chadrc.lua and /config/lspconfig.lua

Plex server config not included.

Libation is not on homebrew. (used for fetching my audible library)

## Aider
Config is loaded from dir where you run Aider, so the `.env` needs to be coppied to where you want to run it.
Deepseek API key needs to be added. (Or some other model configured)
